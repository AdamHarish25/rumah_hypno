    title: "How Hypnotherapy Works",
    description: (
      <>
        This therapy session is generally done between 60-90 minutes. The
        therapist will use a variety of relaxation techniques to guide the
        person into entering a hypnotic state. When this happens, you are
        certainly still in a conscious state, but the body becomes more relaxed
        and the mind is more responsive to suggestions from the therapist.
        <br />
        <br />
        Various suggestions will be made by the therapist depending on the
        condition or disorder that is trying to be overcome.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hypnotherapy can help to get rid of unwanted or unhealthy habits and
        replace them with something better. One thing that can be done is to
        increase the ability to control pain or anxiety, so that bad thought
        patterns can be eliminated so that the problem of depression is
        resolved.
