    Software needs to be updated or even reset or installed the latest operating system to stay productive. Because of corrupted software, the overall performance of the computer will also often have problems.

    Through hypnotherapy, it's easy to replace software that doesn't work well with the latest software, so you can become the best version of yourself in less time without hard drugs.

    title: "Anger Management",
    opening: `Anger management problems often stem from past experiences. These experiences can shape your behavior and belief system. So, while you may think another person or situation is causing your anger, it may well come from yourself. Once this is understood, your hypnotherapist can begin work changing this.
    To do so, your hypnotherapist will work on a conscious and unconscious level to help change your negative thought processes. Doing this may involve relaxation techniques and suggestions from your hypnotherapist to help control your anger.
    The hope is that this will change your reaction to anger triggers. Instead of feeling overwhelmed and angry, you should feel calmer and more relaxed. Feeling calmer in stressful situations helps you to think more clearly so you can react in a more appropriate way.
    Anger management hypnotherapy can also help with some of the symptoms of anger. For example, if you are suffering from anxiety, stress or depression, hypnotherapy can be helpful.`,
    titleC1: "How to deal with anger: Self-help tips:",
    c1: `1. Get to know your triggers
    Understanding what situations make you feel angry is key. By recognizing when you are likely to feel angry, you can be prepared. To do this, start taking notes when you feel angry. Try to note the following:
    -- What was the situation?
    -- Was there another person involved?
    -- What did they say/do to make you feel angry?
    -- How did you feel at the time?
    -- How did you behave?
    -- How did you feel after the incident?
    After a while, you should start to notice some patterns emerging. Perhaps you get angry when you feel belittled, or maybe you feel angrier after the situation because you couldn't express yourself at the time.
    Talk through your notes with your hypnotherapist, as this can help them work with you to understand the underlying reason behind your anger. Just recognizing these patterns can be an enormous help.
    `,
    c2: `2. Give yourself some time
    A simple way to help you manage your anger when a trigger situation arises is to give yourself some time before you react. This allows you to really think about how you react, rather than reacting instinctively. Try the following suggestions to see if they help:
    -- Take some deep breaths - breathing out for longer than you breathe in can help to calm you.
    -- Count to 10 - a simple act that can give you enough time to calm yourself before you react.
    -- Do something else - instead of reacting, try to distract yourself by doing something else. If you can, try to channel that energy into something creative.
    Listen to calming music/sounds - create a calming playlist and listen to it when you start to feel angry.
    Try a few different distraction techniques and see what works best for you. Again, this is something you can discuss with your hypnotherapist as they may have some alternative suggestions.
    `,

    c3: `3. Try some relaxation techniques
    Stress and anger tend to go hand in hand. Many people find reducing their stress levels helps them to keep their anger under control. Relaxation techniques challenge the physical aspects of stress and anger. This can help you refrain from lashing out or behaving violently when you get angry. Try some of the following techniques when you are feeling stressed:
    -- Meditation
    -- Visualization
    -- Yoga
    Breathing exercises
    One of the ways hypnotherapy for anger can help is by triggering the body's relaxation response. During a hypnotherapy session, you will fall into a deeply relaxed state. It is at this point that the hypnotherapist offers suggestions to help control your anger.

    title: "Phobia",
    titleC1: "What are Phobias",
    c1: `A phobia is an irrational and excessive fear of a specific activity, situation, or object that triggers a compelling desire to avoid that thing. If someone has a phobia, to everyone else it may seem silly, but to the person with the phobia it is a genuine fear. Having this phobia is not their fault and not something they can “get over it”.
    Another way of looking at a phobia is as an unconscious automatic response to stimulus, which stems from a misperception of said stimulus. Scientists say that only two fears are hereditary or naturally instinctive: the fear of falling and the fear of loud noises. Everything else is learned. The good news is, that means it can be un-learned.
    Phobias usually start while we are young. However, any traumatic experience we endure, such as serious accidents or injuries, can cause phobias in adulthood.
    There are two main categories of phobias:
    `,
    c2: `Social Phobias – fears involving other people or situations such as:
    -- Public speaking
    -- Performance anxiety
    -- Embarrassment in public, such as eating
    -- General social phobia, known as social anxiety disorder
    -- Specific social phobias, i.e. cases of anxiety triggered only in specific situations such as being unable to urinate in a public bathroom.
    
    Specific phobias – a fear of a single specific panic trigger such as:
    -- Spiders
    -- Dogs
    -- Elevators
    -- Water
    -- Flying
    -- Death
    -- Many, many more
    Phobias can be severe in some individuals while others can simply avoid their fear trigger and have mild anxiety over that fear. Most understand that they suffer from an irrational fear, but they feel powerless in being able to overcome their instinctual panic reaction.
    `,
    titleC3: "What are the 10 Most Common Phobias?",
    c3: `
    1. Arachnophobia – the fear of spiders.
    2. Social Phobia – the fear of being evaluated negatively in social situations i.e. public speaking.
    3. Aerophobia – the fear of flying.
    4. Agoraphobia – the fear of any place or situation where escape is difficult.
    5. Claustrophobia – the fear of being trapped in small confined spaces such as hallways or elevators.
    6. Acrophobia – the fear of heights.
    7. Emetophobia – the fear of vomit.
    8. Carcinophobia – the fear of cancer.
    9. Brontophobia – the fear of thunder and lightning.
    10. Necrophobia – the fear of death.
    `,

    titleC4: "Ending a Life Full of Irrational Fear is Possible",

    c4: `
    There is hope. Phobias can be treated. But when the fear trigger can be easily avoided (for the most part), a person may decide to try and ignore it rather than go for treatment. This can cause the phobia to manifest and cause disruption in one’s life in the future. A phobia may become present with no trigger or reason and it can be difficult to treat with standard psychotherapeutic techniques.
    Many hypnotherapists may use “Parts Therapy” as a treatment to find the part of you that has the phobia. Parts therapy is based on the idea that our personalities are made up of a number of various parts which are aspects of the subconscious, each with a respective job or function in the inner mind.
    Revert that part of you, that part of your personality, to the first time you were aware of the cause of the current phobia. Various hypnotherapy techniques can help to desensitize you, reframe the initial moment about the fear, which allows you to function freely without it. You may be taught self-hypnosis techniques to help reinforce your phobia-free life.

    Opposites of other diet ways that focus on calories intake, the hypnoslimming method uses Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques to help the root of psychometric problems in the subconscious. Hypnoslimming is designed to instill more positive thinking and behavior, so you can separate food from emotional life.

    opening: `Studies have shown that hypnosis can be effective in treating several medical conditions. While hypnosis to stop drinking or stop using drugs can be an effective behavioral tool, hypnotherapy for alcoholism and/ or drug addiction can be even more helpful. Hypnotherapy combines two modalities of treatment – hypnosis and psychotherapy.
    In addition to helping people better understand their addictions, it can also help patients be more likely to stay in a treatment program, attend meetings, and work with sponsors. In short: it can make patients more willing and amenable to various elements of the addiction treatment continuum.
    Furthermore, hypnosis’s pain-relieving properties can also be used to mitigate the physical barriers to recovery, including symptoms like withdrawal, anxiety, muscle tension, spasms, and pain.
    One last thing to keep in mind? Despite its potential, hypnosis is not a magic bullet.  No single session will lead to an instant fix. Nor is it effective for everyone. However, it can be an effective tool that for some people can be used toward the process of addressing the complexities and challenges of addiction.

    opening: `Without realizing it, much of today's adult behavior and personality is the result of how a person's childhood was. Many cases show that bad experiences in childhood make a person grow up to be a coward, insecure, stubborn adult, traumatized by something, or even other deviant behaviors.
    In an Inner Child healing session, the therapist will create a metaphoric story for change. Where the child can explore itself and mature. A story that can empower the child and allow free flow of expression and creativity. The subconscious aspect of the true self is creative and does not know the difference between fact and fantasy.
    So letting go and trusting the subconscious mind to take in the new story as real is essential. The only thing that gets in the way is the critical faculty of the analytical mind. All we need to do is command it to step aside and let the healing take place.

    opening: `Insomnia is a condition when a person has difficulty sleeping or cannot sleep well, often wakes up during sleep, has difficulty initiating sleep, and cannot even achieve normal sleep quality. Insomnia most often occurs in the elderly which is influenced by factors of age, lifestyle, environment, and diet.
    Insomnia hypnotherapy is now widely used as a treatment method, one of which is a treatment for treating insomnia sufferers. Insomnia hypnotherapy works by entering a person's subconscious, then giving certain suggestions to help the healing process. The prevalence of insomnia in the elderly in 2014 in Indonesia was around 10%. In 2015 around 15% and in 2016 around 17%, meaning that approximately 28 million of the total 238 million Indonesian population suffer from insomnia. ( Dinkes, 2019)
    The state of relaxation after hypnosis can increase the client's sense of comfort while in bed, so that the client can easily fall asleep, a relaxed mind reduces the incidence of dreams, decreases the frequency of awakening and increases the total nighttime sleep. In addition to hypnotherapy factors, the therapist also provides self-hypnosis training to clients, self-hypnosis is self-hypnosis that can help clients achieve a relaxed state without being assisted by a therapist.

    title: "Does Hypnotherapy Work? ",
    opening: `While some scientists still regard hypnosis with mistrust, it has proven useful in clinical settings and insightful in research into mental processes such as “sensation, perception, learning, memory, and physiology” (Faymonville et al., 2006).
    Hypnosis is seen as a heightened state of attention, concentration, and inner absorption, with reduced awareness of external stimuli.
    Hypnosis, however, requires three components (Faymonville et al., 2006):
    Absorption – to become fully involved in the imaginative experience
    Dissociation – the separation of behavioral components typically processed together, such as being both an actor and an observer
    Suggestibility – the increased tendency to “comply with hypnotic instructions”
    While hypnotherapy appears promising as a treatment for multiple issues that determine physical and psychological health, much of the research seems flawed because of poor trial design. Therefore, further high-quality studies are required to better understand its potential to improve chronic pain, depression, sleep, and eating disorders (Chamine et al., 2018).
    
    So, does hypnotherapy really work?
    
    Yes, science has confirmed that hypnotherapy can change our perception and behavior.`,
